# ðŸ“Œ 6DoFHPE â€“ Extending with Depth Prediction (DPE)

This project builds upon the existing 6DoFHPE pipeline, which estimates the 6 Degrees of Freedom Head Pose using RGB-D images. To eliminate the dependency on explicit depth input, this extension integrates a Depth Prediction Estimator (DPE) that generates depth maps directly from RGB images. The remaining pipeline remains unchanged, using the predicted depth in place of the actual depth to estimate the translation vector.

This implementation is part of the methodology developed during my Masterâ€™s Thesis, focused on enhancing the practicality and scalability of head pose estimation systems by removing the need for specialized depth cameras.
